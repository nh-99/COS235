This program is used to take a number and convert the number to either a base 2, 3, 4, 8, or 16 number. It uses the
quotient remainder method, in which you keep dividing the number by the new base, keep the remainders and then put them
in reverse order to get the new number. It does this with an array to store remainders, a for loop, and then a reverse
for loop to put the remainders into char form, then returns the char.
